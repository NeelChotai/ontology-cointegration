average number of cointegrated pairs from sampling for random and shared attributes
    split pairs in to x sections
    randomly select y pairs of pairs with z shared attributes
    randomly select y pairs from the total chunk
    compare cointegration percentage
over time, the companies that are linked continue to be cointegrated
    four cases: stay cointegrated, lose cointegration, gain cointegration, stay non-cointegrated
labelling companies based on sector
